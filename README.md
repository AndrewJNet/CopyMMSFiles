# Get-MMSSessionContent

These scripts are used to download the session files that were made available during [Midwest Management Summit 2015-2024](http://mmsmoa.com). If you are involved in configuration/infrastructure/identity/mobile device management primarily in the Microsoft space, consider attending this event!

## Usage

For content just from 2024 in a custom directory (default is C:\Conferences\MMS\$conferenceyear), use the following:

``` .\Get-MMSSessionContent.ps1 -DownloadLocation "C:\Temp\MMS" -ConferenceId 2024atmoa```

For multiple years:

``` .\Get-MMSSessionContent.ps1 -ConferenceList @('2015','2024atmoa')```

To exclude session details:

``` .\Get-MMSSessionContent.ps1 -All -ExcludeSessionDetails```
