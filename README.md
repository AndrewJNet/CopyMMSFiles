These scripts are used to download the session files that were made available during [Midwest Management Summit 2015-2017](http://mmsmoa.com). If you are involved in configuration/infrastructure/identity/mobile device management primarily in the Microsoft space, consider attending this event!

Thank you to [Duncan Russell](http://www.sysadmintechnotes.com/) for providing the initial script for MMS 2014 and helping me test the changes I made for it to work with the more recent conferences.

Thank you to [Evan Yeung](https://github.com/forevanyeung) for cleaning up processing and file naming.

This script is provided as-is with no guarantees. It was tested with PowerShell 5 on Windows 10.
